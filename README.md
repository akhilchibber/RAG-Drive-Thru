## Overview
This project aims to revolutionize the drive-thru ordering process in restaurants by implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. It leverages advanced NLP techniques to automate and accurately respond to customer inquiries about menu items in real-time, enhancing the overall customer experience.

## Components

1. **Vector Database Setup:** Creation of an in-memory vector database to store menu items as vector representations for efficient semantic similarity matching.

2. **Query Processing:** Interpreting customer queries, extracting relevant information, and converting it into a vector form to find the best matching menu items.

3. **Response Generation:** Using retrieved information to generate clear and concise responses to customer inquiries, detailing matched menu items.
